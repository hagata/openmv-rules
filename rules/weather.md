title: Weather System

The weather inside the Metaverse is an interesting topic, not just to bring up in casual conversation when there's nothing else to talk about, but one to seriously discuss and consider. One can't quite talk about the weather in the Metaverse without touching on the topics of control and governance.

Weather is controlled by an individual (or potentially a group) who owns the single access token to the weather system. The one who owns the token at any given point in time has the sole access to change the weather as they please. much like one would change the song on a jukebox. The ownership of the weather token can change at any point as the owner(s) is free to sell/trade/gift it at any point, however, most owners of the weather token hold on to it for a long time, often leaving the weather unchanged for many meta-years at a time.
