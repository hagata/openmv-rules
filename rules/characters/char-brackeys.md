*Sample/test character*

Brackeys is a character within the metaverse. Their outward apprearance is somewhat similar to a human, that is if you count being bipedal with two arms and a head "human". Other than the number of limbs and the way in which they walk, the rest is a bit more rare. With a deep green complexion and features that appear to be ever expanding baloons, at first glance you may be taken aback, but be cautios not to insult them.
